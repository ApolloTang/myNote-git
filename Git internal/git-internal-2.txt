
$echo 'test content' | git hash-object -w --stdin
d670460b4b4aece5915caf5c68d12f560a9fe3e4

	- The above generate a hash-key for the echoed content

	- The -w tells hash-object to store the object; 
      Without this the command simply tells you what the key would be. 

	- --stdin tells the command to read the content from stdin; 
	  if you don’t specify this, hash-object expects the path to a file.

$git hash-object -w test.txt
	
	- The above generate a hash-key for content in test.txt and store
		this content in the database and use this hash-key as its name

$ git cat-file -p d670460b4b4aece5915caf5c68d12f560a9fe3e4
test content

	- Pull the content back out of Git with the cat-file command. 
	- -p to it instructs the cat-file command to figure out the 
	  type of content and display it nicely for you


$ git cat-file -p master^{tree}

	- The master^{tree} syntax specifies the tree object 
      that is pointed to by the last commit on your master branch


$ git cat-file -p 99f1a6d12cb4b6f19c8655fca46c3ecf317074e0
100644 blob 47c6340d6459e05787f644c2447d2595f5d3a54b      simplegit.rb

	The above eg gived you content of a tree object
	a single entry of tree entry conteins:

		mode	 100644
		type	 blob
		SHA-1	 47c6340d6459e05787f644c2447d2595f5d3a54b
		filename simplegit.rb


$ git update-index --add --cacheinfo 100644 \
  83baae61804e65cc73a7201a7252750c76066a30 test.txt

	The above create a new staging area and artificially place a 
	content in your database in this new staging area.
	A specified filename will be associated with this content, 
	and filemode is also set

	"--add" option is required becaue the file doesn't exist in staging area
	"--cacheinfo" option is required because the file you are adding is not in
				your director but  is in your database (.git/objects/)
	
	::: git file mode :::
	100644 normal file  = 110,100,100 rw-,r--,r--
	100755 executable	= 111,101,101 rwx,r-x,r-x
    100000 symbolic link

$ git write-tree

	write the staging area out to a tree object
	no -w option is needed. it automatically creates a tree object 
	from the state of the index if that tree doesn’t yet exist
