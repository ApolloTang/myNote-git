To get data from your remote projects, run:

	$ git fetch [remote-name]


The command goes out to that remote project and pulls down all the data from that remote project that you don’t have yet. 

This command load any new work that has been pushed to that server since you cloned (or last fetched from) it. 

After you do this, you should have references to all the branches from that remote, which you can merge in or inspect at any time.

It’s important to note that the fetch command pulls the data to your local repository — it doesn’t automatically merge it with any of your work or modify what you’re currently working on. You have to merge it manually into your work when you’re ready.

If you want git to merge it for you, run:

	$ git pull [remote-name] 

this command load data from the server you originally cloned from and automatically tries to merge it into the code you’re currently working on.


Load your project to remote server, use:

	$ git push [remote-name] [branch-name]
