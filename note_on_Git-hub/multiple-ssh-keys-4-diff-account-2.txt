	$ ssh-add -l
	The agent has no identities.

	$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
	Enter passphrase for /c/Users/apollo/.ssh/id_rsa:
	Identity added: /c/Users/apollo/.ssh/id_rsa (/c/Users/apollo/.ssh/id_rsa)

	$ ssh-add -l
	2048 d4:f2:49:c1:1e:d8:ff:fe:23:98:9f:d6:d2:12:3f:be /c/Users/apollo/.ssh/id_rsa

	$ ssh -T git@bitbucket.org
	logged in as apollotang.

	You can use git or hg to connect to Bitbucket. Shell access is disabled.
	
	OR
	
	$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/dearbanana
	Enter passphrase for /c/Users/apollo/.ssh/dearbanana:
	Identity added: /c/Users/apollo/.ssh/dearbanana (/c/Users/apollo/.ssh/dearbanana)
	
::: Link a local repository to an identiy

	$ less ~/.ssh/config
	Host *
	  ServerAliveInterval 60

	#tang.apollo@gmail.com
	Host bb-tag      <---------------- [this short name is map to] -----.
	  HostName bitbucket.org                                            |
	  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub    <----[key in this file, remote host bitbucket.org has a copy] 
	Host gh-tag
	  HostName github.com
	  User git
	  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

	#dearbanana@gmail.com
	Host gh-dbg
	  Hostname github.com
	  User git
	  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/dearbanana.pub

so now any remote ssh-repository (such as bitbucket.org and github.com)
that has the public key	identical to that in ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub will map 
short names "bb-tag" or "gh-tag".   
 
Similar any remote ssh-agent that has the public key identical to 
that in ~/.ssh/dearbanana.pub will be map to short name "gh-dbg".
