    Warning: port definitions are more than two weeks old, consider

    To use bash_completion, add the following lines at the end of your
    .bash_profile:

      if [ -f /opt/local/etc/profile.d/bash_completion.sh ]; then
          . /opt/local/etc/profile.d/bash_completion.sh
      fi

    The port bash-completion >=2.0 requires bash >=4.1; please make sure
    you are using /opt/local/bin/bash by changing the preferences of your
    terminal accordingly. If your version of bash is too old, the script
    above will not modify your shell environment and no extended completion
    will be available.

    ....

    To make python 2.7 the default (i.e. the version you get when you run 'python'),
    please run:

    sudo port select --set python python27

    ....

    To use the rsyncd server you must copy /opt/local/etc/rsyncd.conf.example to
    rsyncd.conf and add your modules there. See 'man rsyncd.conf' for more
    information.

   $ which git
   /opt/local/bin/git
