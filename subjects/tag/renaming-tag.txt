How to rename tag

    First you need to build an alias of the old tag name:

        > git tag new_tag_name old_tag_name

    Then you need to delete the old one locally:

        > git tag -d old_tag_name

    Then delete the tag on you remote location(s):


        > git remote -v
            # The argument (3rd) is your remote location,
            # the one you can see with `git remote`. In this example: `origin`

        > git push origin :refs/tags/old_tag_name

    Finally you need to add your new tag to the remote location.
    Until you haven't done this, the new tag(s) will not be added:

        > git push origin --tags

    Iterate this for every remote location.
