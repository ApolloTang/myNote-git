
::: Delete Local Branch 

        git branch -d <branchname>    # deletes local branch

::: Delete Remote Branch

    As of Git v1.7.0, you can delete a remote branch using

        git push origin --delete <branchName>

    which is easier to remember than

        git push origin :<branchName>

    which was added in Git v1.5.0 "to delete a remote branch or a tag."



    [!] Only the references are deleted. Even though the branch is actually removed on
    the remote the references to it still exists in the local repositories of your team
    members. 

    This means that for other team members the deleted branches are still visible
    when they do a git branch -a.

    To solve this your team members can prune the deleted branches with

        git remote prune <repository>

    This is typically git remote prune origin.
