Before you can start working locally on a remote branch, you need to fetch it as called out in answers below.

To fetch a branch, you simply need to:

    git fetch origin

This will fetch all of the remote branches for you. You can see the branches available for checkout with:

    git branch -v -a

With the remote branches in hand, you now need to check out the branch you are interested in, giving you a local working copy:

    git checkout -b test origin/test
    
    
EDIT - The answer below actually improves on this. On Git>=1.6.6 you can just do:

    git fetch
    git checkout test
