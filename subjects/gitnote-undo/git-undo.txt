::::  Undo change to a file after commit

Revert file "index.html" in the working directory back to the one same as *previous commit* ( if you haven't add 
that change to the staging area :

            [working dir]     [stage]       [repository]
             "index.html"   "index.html"    "index.html"
              modified    previous commit    previous commit
                  x <------------x
                  |
                  |
                  v
             "index.html"   "index.html"    "index.html"
            previous commit   previous commit  previous commit
                

    $ git checkout -- index.html
                   ^^-- the double dash is there to make sure the file "index.html" 
                        is checkout from the repository, not the branch "index.html" ( who know?
                        we might have a branch called "index.html".

                      
                      
                      
                      
                      
::::  Unstage a file: 
                   
    say you try to put together a commit, you have serveral file in the stage. But then
    you relize one of the file should not belong to this commit because it is a different
    subject.  So you need to unstage that file                      

            [working dir]     [stage]       [repository]
            "index.html"   "index.html"    "index.html"
             modified        modified      previous commit
                                x <-------------- x
                                |
                                |
                                v
            "index.html"   "index.html"    "index.html"
             modified    previous commit   previous commit
 
    
    $ git reset HEAD index.html
    
    
    
    
    
:::: Undo (amend) a commit

    You can only amend the commit at the end (tip) of a branch (watch video g07-03 for explaination)
    amend can be done to either the content in working dir or to the commit message, or  both
    
    $ git vi myfile.html    // modifying myfile.html
    $ git add myfile.html
    $ git commit --amend -m "Your new message"   // your previous commit is updated to the new 
                                                 //     content
    


 
:::: retrive a file from a specific commit and put it into the *stage area* and *working diretory*. 

    $ git checkout add1a8a0a61 -- index.html
                   [1]        [2]    [3]
                   
                   [1] commit SHA-1 identifier
                   [2] "--" to tell git that we are not checkout a branch
                   [3] name of the file to check out
                   
        After the above command "git diff" should show nothing (because "git diff" show diff btw 
        working directory and stage area )

        
             [working dir]     [stage]       [repository]        [repository]
             "index.html"   "index.html"    "index.html"          "index.html"
              modefied      commit 5cc1      commit 5cc1          commit add1a8  
                  x               x 
                  |               |
                  |               |
                  |               v
                  v               x <-----------------------------------x
                  x <---------------------------------------------------+
                                                                          

             "index.html"   "index.html"    
            commit add1a8   commit add1a8 
               (modified)     (modified)
               
    [note confusion!!!!] 
    In the video(lynda g07-04) it said the command:
        "$ git checkout add1a8a0a61 -- index.html" 
    retrive "index.html" from commit "add1a" and put it into the stage area and DOES NOT over
    write the working directory. and he can use the command: "$ git reset HEAD index.html"
    to undo "$ git checkout add1a8a0a61 -- index.html".
    
    but this is not what I see, I see that "$ git checkout add1a8a0a61 -- index.html" 
    retrive "index.html" from commit "add1a" and put it into the BOTH *stage area* and 
    *working dir* (file "index.html" is overwriten). And the command: 
    "$ git reset HEAD index.html" can not undo "$ git checkout add1a8a0a61 -- index.html"
    To undo "$ git checkout add1a8a0a61 -- index.html", I use "$ git checkout 5cc1 -- index.html"
