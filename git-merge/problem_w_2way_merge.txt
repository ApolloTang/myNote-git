When performing two way merge, the tool does not know whether
I added a line or you remove a line. To illustrate this:


    myfile.txt

        same 1
            different stuff
        same 2


    yourfile.txt

        same 1
        same 2


    two possible hitories

        history 1

            the file was:

                same 1
                same 2

            then I added a line in between


        history 2

            the file was:

                same 1
                    different stuff
                same 2

            then you delete a line in between
