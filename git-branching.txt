::: List Branch

    git branch              // list local branch
    git branch -r           // list remote branch
    git branch -a           // list remote and local branch
    git branch --merged     // show all branches that are complete included in current branch
                            //      which mean you can safely remove the branch(es) without asterisk
                            //      b/c there have already been included in current branch.
    
    
::: Branch Operation

    git branch {branch-name}        // create a branch, will not switch to the newly created branch
    git checkout {branch-name}      // switch branch

    git checkout -b {branch-name}   // create a branch and switch to it

    git branch -d {branch-name}     // delete a branch

    git branch -m <old_branch-name> <new_branch-name> // same as "--move"
    


    



 
:::: Note

- The current branch which HEAD is pointing to is specified in ".git/HEAD" and that will be
  a file in directory ".git/refs/heads/"
- All the available branches to HEAD are specified in files in  directory ".git/refs/heads/"
- The files in ".git/refs/heads/" contain a SHA-1 of the commit obj for  that particular branch.
- You can see the content of the commit object with "$git cat-file -p <SHA-1>"
