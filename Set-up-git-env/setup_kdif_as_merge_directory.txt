Your can also use kdiff3 to diff the entire director between commit. See :
   
    http://www.vflare.org/2009/12/comprehensive-graphical-git-diff-viewer.html

    you need to download 'git-diffc' from the following link :

        https://code.google.com/p/compcache/source/browse/sub-projects/scripts/git-diffc

    place git-diffc in:

        C:\Program Files (x86)\Git\local\bin\
    
    add to your .bashrc:

        # set env for /local/bin/git-diffc
        export TMPDIR=/c/Users/apollo/tmp    # location of temp folder
        export CLEANUP=0                     # don't clean up
        # DO NOT SET GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF. IF YOU DO git-diffc WILL NOT WORK

    git-diffc works just like git diff (take the same argument), as an example, you want
    to compare the entire directory between commit eec9f69 and commit 084cced:
    
        $ git-diffc eec9f69 084cced
        [(1.txt) : (c:/Users/apollo/tmp/C4N1Ca_1.txt) : (1.txt)]
        [(2.txt) : (c:/Users/apollo/tmp/XUX9Pd_2.txt) : (2.txt)]
        source: /c/Users/apollo/tmp/.git_diffc/diff.7454
        /c/Users/apollo/tmp/.git_diffc/diff.7454/old /c/Users/apollo/tmp/.git_diffc/diff.7454/new
