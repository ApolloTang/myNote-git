Committing

Committing Your Changes

    $ git commit 		// use default editor to write comment
    $ git commit –v	// verbose: include the diff of your change in the comment
    $ git commit –m "Bug fixed"	// inline comment


Skipping the Staging Area, go to commit directly.

    $ git commit –a –m 'bug fixed'

the following  is equivalent to above:

    $ git commit –am 'bug fixed'
    $ git commit –a –-message='bug fixed'

    [!] Watch out when using "–am":
    •	This will grabs everything in working directory -- so if there is something 
        you don't want to include in the change it will get commit as well.
    •	files that are not tracked or files that has been deleted do not get 
        included (so "-am" works well for file modification, but does not 
        work well for new file or deleted file.)
